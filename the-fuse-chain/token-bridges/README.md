# Token Bridges

We have two bridges as explained below

1. Fuse Bridge:  ****The bridge, based on POA's bridge implementation, is used to transfer Fuse tokens between the Fuse chain and the Ethereum network.
2. ERC20 token bridge: This bridge is used to transfer ERC20 tokens into Fuse chain and back. Please not that Fuse bridge is not supposed to be used to transfer
